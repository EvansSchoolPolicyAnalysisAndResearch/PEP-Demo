### Problem Statement
Too few Americans have access to equitable post-secondary education. With the Policy Exploration Platform, you can explore evidence from federal data on community colleges.

### Purpose
  
This app allows you to explore the current landscape of post-secondary education opportunities and challenges in rural regions of the United States, focusing on community colleges. Using recent data from [IPEDS](https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/use-the-data), you can examine enrollment patterns, access to distance education, and demographic trends to better understand how rural students engage with higher education and what barriers they may face.
